The purpose of this file is to provide a comprehensive test.

For support, please call +48 123-456-7890 during office hours. For after-hours assistance, dial +1 987.654.3210.
Make sure to document your calls and emails properly.

In addition to these, we have other contacts:

- Samantha's phone: 456-789-1234

We expect the file to contain:
- Multiple lines and paragraphs

Moreover, let's add some complexity: Can you spot the email hidden in this sentence: hidden.email@domain.co.uk?
And how about this phone number: +33 321.654.9870?

Finally, note that every character counts, including spaces, punctuation, and newlines.

Thank you for testing!
